# FFT Monte Carlo for Additive Processes

Additive processes are becoming the new frontier in equity derivatives as they are able to accurately replicate market-implied volatility term structures. 
This project led to the implementation of a Monte Carlo numerical scheme leveraging on the fast Fourier transform algorithm which allows to deal with the above mentioned processes. 
This simulation technique is a fast and accurate solution for the path-dependent option valuation problem.
